# wikidump

This is not a serious project. Please do not try to use it for anything. The
sole purpose of this project is for me to play with and explore some
technologies related to Clojure, JSON and text search.

Should you take the time to look at the code, please do not hesitate to suggest
improvements; in fact, this is the very reason this project is public.
